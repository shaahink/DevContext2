| # | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1.1 | `map` returns the structured Map surface (library surface, packages, aggregates, service styles); its markdown stops advertising CLI flags that don't exist over MCP | ✅ DONE | [`cf1a822`](https://github.com/shaahink/DevContext2/commit/cf1a822) |

| G1.3 | Seam glyphs match the proto (singular/plural), handle-less calls stop retargeting across repos, RpcException stops leaking past the error envelope on all five tools | ✅ DONE | [`75704f2`](https://github.com/shaahink/DevContext2/commit/75704f2) |
| G1.4 | `find(kind:)` filters server-side so total/hasMore are true; `analyze` returns an honest long-run note + a `cached` flag | ✅ DONE | [`a09c456`](https://github.com/shaahink/DevContext2/commit/a09c456) |

## Last gate run

fast-engine:OK · guards:OK

## Last session result

> SESSION-RESULT: I fixed the `fast-engine` red at its root — `AnalyzeCacheTruthTests` was failing ~30% of runs because five concurrent xUnit collections each owned one process-wide `DEVCONTEXT_CACHE_ROOT`, so I moved the cache root into `ServerOptions` and inject it per host, added `loom-guards` Rule 7 to ban the env write from tests (verified it fires), and made one opaque `DirectoryNotFoundException` report as "zero snapshots" without changing the bar; verified 0 failures in 25 runs of the full 104-test assembly, `fast-engine` exit 0, `guards` exit 0, build 0w/0e, committed and pushed as 5b401dd + c1949ef. Still red/open: bug #16, a second and much rarer failure in the same class (`third.Ca…

## Tracker handoff

```
**s17's `fast-engine` red was a FLAKY TEST, at ~1 run in 3. Root-caused, fixed, verified: both fast
gates exit 0** (`eval-results/2026-07-29/G5-s18/`, full writeup in `G5-s18-EVIDENCE.md`). Nothing was
weakened; one gate got stricter. **G5.2 is still the next job and no G5 checkpoint is claimed.**
Measured: 5 failures / 15 before (`loop-A-repro-multiclass.txt`), **0 / 25** after on the whole
104-test assembly (`loop-D`). Cause: `DEVCONTEXT_CACHE_ROOT` is process-wide and **five** concurrent
xUnit collections each wrote it in their ctor (3 × `ServerTestFactory` + `HostReleaseTests` +
`AnalyzeCacheTruthTests`), so a neighbour could steal the root between a test's ctor and its
`EngineRunner`; `ServerTestFactory` restored **null**, aiming stragglers at the real user cache. Fix:
new `ServerOptions.SnapshotCacheRoot`, injected — plus **loom-guards Rule 7** banning that env write
from tests, watched going red on demand (`canary-rule7-OUTPUT.txt`).
**Consequence for the board: `fast-engine` was a coin flip from G3.3 onward, so G5.1's and G1.2's
`fast-engine:FAIL` annotations are false reds** (G1.2's is s17's harness abort); both checkpoints'
work is fine, and any single green `fast-engine` in that window proved less than it looked.
**Still open — bug #16**, a SECOND, rarer red in the same class (`third.Cached` false, 1-in-50). Its
obvious cause was tested and **refuted**: the cache key really does track the whole working tree
(`probe-versionkey.ps1`), but churning the tree does not redden the test (0/14). Do not re-derive it.
**G5.2 is unchanged and still a checklist** — build to `eval-results/2026-07-29/G5.1/G5.1-EVIDENCE.md`
§5, do not re-derive §1–§4. Defect 1 (`this.<field>.<M>()` reaching `CallGraphBinder.cs:250`'s
self-call arm) + join the execute MEMBER (`CliCommandEntryPointBuilder.cs:29-40` drops the detected
`ExecuteMethod`) → `0/5 → 4/5`; `test` calls nothing and must stay honestly unwired. Bug #12 stays
OUT of G5.2. **Budget the cold snapshot** (any Core edit trips bug #1's false 0/12), and **write
verification logs outside the repo** — `eval-results/` is untracked-but-not-ignored, so a growing log
there is itself a working-tree change the cache keys on.
```
